1208 â€“ Get Equal Substrings Within Budget (https://leetcode.com/problems/get-equal-substrings-within-budget/)

You are given two strings s and t of the same length and an integer maxCost.

You want to change s to t. Changing the ith character of s to ith character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]|
(i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).

Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of t with a cost less than or equal to maxCost.
If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.


Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0
Output: 1


Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 105
t.length == s.length
0 <= maxCost <= 106
s and t consist of only lowercase English letters.
