713 â€“ Subarray Product Less Than K (https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-product-less-than-k/)

Given an array of positive integers nums and an integer k, return the number of subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than k.

For example, given the input nums = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 100, the answer is 8. The subarrays with products less than k are:
[10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]

# construct a for loop that will slide the right pointer along the array
    for right in range(len(nums)):

        # multiply by the rightmost integer to update the cumulative product
        product *= nums[right]
