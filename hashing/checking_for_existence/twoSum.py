1 â€“ Two Sum (https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of two numbers such that they add up to target.
You cannot use the same index twice.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]


Constraints:
2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
