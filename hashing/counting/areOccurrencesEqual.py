1941 â€“ Check if All Characters Have Equal Number of Occurrences (https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-all-characters-have-equal-number-of-occurrences/)

Given a string s, return true if s is a good string, or false otherwise.

A string s is good if all the characters that appear in s have the same number of occurrences (i.e., the same frequency).


Example 1:
Input: s = "abacbc"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "aaabb"
Output: false


Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists of lowercase English letters.
