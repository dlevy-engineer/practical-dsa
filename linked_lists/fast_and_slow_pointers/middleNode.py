"""
Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.


Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]


Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100
